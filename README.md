# BouncingCircles
Simple stress-reliever made with bouncing circles that move with your phone.

Made with Processing. In order to run this app, first download processing from their website: https://processing.org/download/. After this, open the files, and switch the IDE to Android instead of Java in the upper right corner.

After hitting "run" in the upper left, the app will be built on your phone. There will be several balls bouncing with gravity being whatever orientation your phone is in.

If you hold with your fingers, the balls will be attracted to it, and when you release, they will explode outward with a force that increases teh longer you hold down for. The balls will be attracted to your fingers current position if it is held down and moved.

Enjoy!
